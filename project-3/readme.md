Start your README by laying out your ideas:
1. What type of writer's site do you think you'll make? (Blog, News, Book, etc.)
2. Where will you get your material? ("Write it myself," use this <u>book title</u>, cite <cite>this article</cite>, etc)
3. How do you think you'll layout your site?
4. **Include an image of your color palette,** and state your reasoning.
