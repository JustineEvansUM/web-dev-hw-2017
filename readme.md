# "Intro to Web Design" Student Profile

Welcome to our course! Please use this template for your first readme response. Don't worry if you don't know what a readme is yet... We'll get there!

This first markup language we'll explore as a class is *markdown* (file extension **.md**). Markdown is a lightweight, easy-to-understand laguage that correlates well with our second and main language, HTML. See what I mean by checking out [this example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#Example)!
